# Mover: Data-Driven Solutions for Climate Change

## 📌 Overview
**Mover** is a collaborative project developed as part of the **"Data Analytics For Climate Change Resolution And Sustainable Development"** independent study at **Zenius**. This project integrates three learning paths: **Data Analytics, UI-UX Design, and Project Management**, aiming to leverage data-driven insights for climate change solutions and sustainable development.

## 🔍 Understanding Mover
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns that affect human existence. The interaction of climate-forming elements and external factors such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations, and human activities—such as fossil fuel combustion—contribute to climate change.

The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide, leading to global warming. Air pollution is an urgent issue in Indonesia, impacting both the environment and public health.

As part of the commitment to the Paris Agreement, it is crucial to protect the environment by adopting eco-conscious behaviors, such as using public transportation to reduce pollution and fuel consumption. Since nature is humanity’s home, environmental conditions directly affect societal well-being. Therefore, increasing public transportation usage is essential to minimize pollution, conserve fuel, and safeguard the planet.

## 🎯 Project Goal
To develop an application that promotes public transportation usage, aiming to reduce pollution and fuel consumption through public awareness campaigns.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Climate Data Analysis:** Utilizing machine learning and statistical methods to analyze climate change patterns.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** User-friendly visualizations for decision-making.
- **Sustainable Solutions:** Data-driven recommendations for environmental sustainability.
